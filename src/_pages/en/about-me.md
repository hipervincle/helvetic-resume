<h2 class="section print-only"><i class="fa-solid fa-user"></i> Professional Profile</h2>
A master watchmaker with a passion for precision in all its forms, whether in the intricate dance of horological mechanics, the aerial ballet of helicopter flight, or the logical elegance of language design. 

For over 25 years, I've dedicated myself to the craft of watchmaking, blending traditional Swiss techniques with innovative, bespoke engineering.  My skills extend beyond the workshop to the skies, where I spend a month each year piloting helicopters, and to the realm of linguistic creation, where I've developed *Lingua Tempus*, a unique programming language rooted in Latin grammar.
